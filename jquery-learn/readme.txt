jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things
like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and
Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of
browsers.

== jQuery UI

jQuery UI contains many widgets that maintain state and therefore may have a
slightly different usage pattern than typical jQuery plugins you are already used
to. While the initialization is the same as most jQuery plugins, jQuery UI's widgets
are built on top of the Widget Factory which provides the same general API to all of them.
