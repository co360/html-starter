<!--
Lodash and Underscore are two commonly used JS libraries. They are like
jQuery, but little lower level and not specific to browser.

NOTE: "low dash" is another name for "underscore"!

As of 08-05-2019, Lodash is more popular than Underscore.

Note: Both libraries expose "_" as global variable, so you may want
to use "noConflict()" to use another name.
