     The controller of custom elements on a web document is the CustomElementRegistry object (customElements) — this object allows you to register a custom element on the page, return information on what custom elements are registered, etc.

     To register a custom element on the page, you use the CustomElementRegistry.define() method. This takes as its arguments:
     - A DOMString representing the name you are giving to the element. Note that custom element names require a dash to be used in them; they can't be single words.
     - A class object that defines the behaviour of the element.
     - Optionally, an options object containing an extends property, which specifies the built-in element your element inherits from if any.

        }
    }
    customElements.define('word-count', WordCount, { extends: 'p' });
