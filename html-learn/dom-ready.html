        // There are few ways to setup callback function when HTML DOM is ready.

        /*
        Option1:
         The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the initial HTML document has been
         completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and
         subframes to finish loading.

         https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/DOMContentLoaded_event
        */
        window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
            console.log("DOM is ready.", event);
        });

        /*
        Option2:

         The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all
         dependent resources such as stylesheets images. This is in contrast to
         DOMContentLoaded, which is fired as soon as the page DOM has been loaded,
         without waiting for resources finish loading.

         https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onload
         https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event
        */
        window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
            console.log("Page is fully loaded, and so DOM is ready.", event);
        });

        /*
        Option3:

        This is same as Option2, but with "onload" handler.

        NOTE: "document.onload" will not work on Chrome 75.0.3770.142!
         */
        window.onload = function() {
            console.log("window.onload handler: Page is fully loaded, and so DOM is ready.");
        }

        /*
        Option4:

        Use jQuery's $().ready() function, or the more common shorthand: $() function.

        One big difference the jQuery has is that event such as "DOMContentLoaded"
        will fire only one time, and if you miss it, it will not get call! But jQuery
        will ensure it will be executed!

        NOTE: $().ready() or $(document).ready() are deprecated. Use $() instead.

/*
Option5:

Another often used method is simply place <script> tag at the end of the
html document.
