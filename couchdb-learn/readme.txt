Install DB and run Admin Console:

Create a database "hello" and then you can access it here:

  http://127.0.0.1:5984/hello -> view db information
  http://127.0.0.1:5984/hello/_all_docs -> list of all documents
  http://127.0.0.1:5984/hello/{_id} -> get single document

You can use Admin Console to create any documents and explore around.
