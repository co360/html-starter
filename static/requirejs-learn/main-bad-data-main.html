<!--
Note that the "data-main" attribute value is without the ".js" extension!

WARNING: if you were to use "data-main" attribute, you can not assume that it
will be loaded BEFORE you start using require() right in this HTML! This
will resulted in NO ERROR during load, but it will not find the modules you
setup in your config options in "data-main"! The best way is NOT to do this
and use load by script-tag to define the config option instead.
