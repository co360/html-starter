# RequireJS

RequireJS loads plain JavaScript files as well as more defined modules. It is
optimized for in-browser use, including in
[a Web Worker](https://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#webworker), but it can be used
in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and
[Node](https://requirejs.org/docs/node.html). It implements the
[Asynchronous Module](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD)
API.

RequireJS uses plain script tags to load modules/files, so it should allow for
easy debugging. It can be used
[simply to load existing JavaScript files](https://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#jsfiles),
so you can add it to your existing project without having to re-write your
JavaScript files.
