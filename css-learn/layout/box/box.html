    All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used
    when talking about design and layout.

    The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists
    of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

    Explanation of the different parts:

    Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
    Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
    Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
    Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear

    The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.

    We can control the box size with "width" and "height".

        height: 300px;
        border: 15px solid green;
        margin: 20px;
        padding: 50px;
